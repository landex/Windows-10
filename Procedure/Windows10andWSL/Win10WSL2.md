# Windows 10 and WSL2

This is my configuration to use Windows 10 to run my projects of Testing Automation, in Windows 10. I hope that this document help you too. Good Luck!!!

## Font

The first thing that I installed is the font **Fira Code** is the best font of moment for me, and I like the ligatures. So make download of font in this [link](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/5.2/Fira_Code_v5.2.zip).

After make download the installation, uising your zip tool uncompress the folder and in sub folder **ttf** select to install all.
