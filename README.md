# Windows-10

After 5 Years, I return to Windows, and I'll share the configuration that is necessary for me to use Windows.

My new laptop is Acer Swift 3 with I5 10th 16GB of Ram and NVME 256GB, maybe in future I'll swap the NVME from 256 to 512GB.

Let's start, see the file [myWindows10](https://github.com/landex/Windows-10/blob/main/Procedure/myWindows10.md) to see details, of my configuration.
